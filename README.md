This project creates an image captioning system that employs VGG-16-based CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for generating descriptive captions from the Flickr8k dataset. It integrates deep learning to interpret image content and produce natural language descriptions. Performance is quantitatively evaluated using BLEU scores, indicating a solid base with room for nuanced improvements. Potential applications range from digital content moderation to preliminary medical diagnoses.
